# SaltySDPatcher
An automatic code.bin patcher for [shinyquagsire's SaltySD](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/SaltySD).

Usage:

If you don't specify a folder, the newest SaltySD ASM files will be downloaded and compiled for you (note that this require DevkitPro to be installed for this to work).

Have fun!
